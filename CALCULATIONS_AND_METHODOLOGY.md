# Environmental Map: Calculations and Methodology

This document describes how all values, scales, filters, and ratings are calculated in the application. Data is from the **CHEL 2022** (Climate and Health Equity Index) dataset.

---

## 1. Data source and variables

The map uses one GeoJSON dataset (e.g. `chel2022.geojson`) with one value per hex for each variable. Only variables that have numeric values and can be summarized are shown.

| Display name              | Dataset field | Description                          | Unit in data / legend   |
|---------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Air Pollution (PM2.5)     | E_PM          | Fine particulate matter concentration| μg/m³                    |
| Asthma Rates              | EP_ASTHMA     | Asthma prevalence                    | %                        |
| Air Pollution Percentile  | EPL_PM        | Percentile of air pollution (0–1)   | shown as 0–100% in legend|
| Ozone                     | E_OZONE       | Ground-level ozone concentration     | ppm                      |
| Ozone Percentile          | EPL_OZONE     | Percentile of ozone (0–1)            | shown as 0–100% in legend|
| Social Vulnerability      | SPL_SVM       | Social Vulnerability Index           | index (no unit in data)  |
| Population                | E_TOTPOP      | Total population in hex              | people (legend only)      |

## 2. How the scale breakpoints are computed (all variables)

Breakpoints are **not fixed**. They are computed from the **distribution of the selected variable across all hexes** in the loaded dataset.

### Step 1: Collect and sort values

For the selected variable (e.g. `EP_ASTHMA`):

1. Take that variable’s value from **every** hex in the dataset.
2. Keep only valid numeric values.
3. Sort them from smallest to largest.

### Step 2: Compute four percentiles

Using the sorted list, the app computes four percentile values:

- **q20** = value at the 20th percentile (20% of hexes have a value below this)
- **q40** = value at the 40th percentile  
- **q60** = value at the 60th percentile  
- **q80** = value at the 80th percentile  

Formula used: for probability `p` in {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8}, the value at percentile `p` is  
`values[ floor((N - 1) × p) ]`  
where `N` is the number of hexes and the array is 0‑indexed.

The same logic also produces **min** (smallest value) and **max** (largest value) for that variable.

### Step 3: Define the five bands

These four numbers become the breakpoints for the legend and map colors:

| Band        | Rule (value = hex’s value for that variable) |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Very Low   | value ≤ q20                                   |
| Low        | q20 &lt; value ≤ q40                          |
| Moderate   | q40 &lt; value ≤ q60                          |
| High       | q60 &lt; value ≤ q80                          |
| Very High  | value &gt; q80                                |

So the scale is **relative to the dataset**: e.g. “Low” means in the 20th–40th percentile of all hexes for that variable, not “low” against an external health standard.

---

## 3. How the legend numbers are displayed

The **same** breakpoints (q20, q40, q60, q80) are shown in the legend; only the formatting changes by variable type:

- **Population (E_TOTPOP):** Breakpoints are rounded to **integers** and formatted with commas (e.g. 20,667). The legend unit is **“people”**.
- **Ozone Percentile / Air Pollution Percentile (EPL_OZONE, EPL_PM):** Values are on a 0–1 scale in the data. They are shown as **0–100** (e.g. 20, 40, 60, 80) with unit **“%”** in the legend.
- **Social Vulnerability (SPL_SVM):** Breakpoints shown as-is; legend unit is **“index”**.
- **All others (e.g. Asthma %, PM2.5, Ozone ppm):** Breakpoints shown with one decimal place when needed; unit comes from the catalog (e.g. %, μg/m³, ppm).

The note under the scale explains what the numbers are (e.g. “Values in %” or “Values for [variable name]”).

## 4. Map filtering (clicking a legend band)

When a user clicks a legend band, the map is **filtered** so that only hexes in that band are shown (others are hidden or styled as “no data”).

Filter logic:

- **Very Low (≤ q20):** show hexes where `value ≤ q20` (strictly: value &lt; q20 for the first break; implementation may use ≤ for the first bin).
- **Low, Moderate, High:** show hexes where value is in the corresponding **closed‑open** interval, e.g. `q20 ≤ value &lt; q40` for Low.
- **Very High (&gt; q80):** show hexes where `value &gt; q80` (or `value ≥ q80` depending on implementation).

So the same breakpoints used for coloring are used for filtering; no extra calculation.

## 5. Hex sidebar: “Xth percentile” and the percentile bar

When you click a hex, the sidebar shows each factor and “**Xth percentile**” (and a bar) for that hex. That percentile is **not** “your value ÷ total”. It is:

- **For EPL_PM and EPL_OZONE:** The value in the data is already on a 0–1 scale, so:  
  **percentile = round(value × 100)**  
  (e.g. 0.35 → 35th percentile).

- **For all other variables:**  
  1. Use the same **min, max, q20, q40, q60, q80** for that variable (from the full dataset).  
  2. See which interval the hex’s value falls in (e.g. between q40 and q60).  
  3. **Linearly interpolate** within that interval to get a 0–100 percentile:
    - Below min → 0.
    - Above max → 100.
    - Between min and q20 → interpolate 0–20.
    - Between q20 and q40 → interpolate 20–40.
    - Between q40 and q60 → interpolate 40–60.
    - Between q60 and q80 → interpolate 60–80.
    - Between q80 and max → interpolate 80–100.

So the “Xth percentile” is “where this hex sits in the distribution,” not a share of a sum.

## 6. Overall environmental burden (hex sidebar)

The **overall environmental burden** for a hex is a single summary across the **environmental factors** (not population). It is **not** a weighted sum of raw values.

### Step 1: Rank each factor (1–5)

For each factor (e.g. PM2.5, Asthma, Ozone, Ozone Percentile, Air Pollution Percentile, Social Vulnerability), the hex’s value is compared to that factor’s q20, q40, q60, q80:

- Below q20 → rank **1** (Very Low)  
- q20 to q40 → **2** (Low)  
- q40 to q60 → **3** (Moderate)  
- q60 to q80 → **4** (High)  
- Above q80 → **5** (Very High)  

Population can be included in the factor list; the same quintile rules apply.

### Step 2: Average the numeric ranks

- Average = (sum of those ranks) / (number of factors with valid data).
- If a factor has no data for that hex, it is skipped (not counted in the average).

### Step 3: Convert average back to a label

- average &lt; 1.5 → **Very Low**  
- average &lt; 2.5 → **Low**  
- average &lt; 3.5 → **Moderate**  
- average &lt; 4.5 → **High**  
- otherwise → **Very High**  

So “High” or “Very High” overall burden means the hex tends to be in the higher quintiles across the included factors (worse conditions), not that a single number is above a fixed threshold.

## 7. Rank labels and colors (sidebar)

Each factor’s rank (Very Low … Very High) is shown with:

- **Short label:** Favorable (Very Low/Low), Moderate, Elevated (High), High (Very High).
- **Colors:** Chosen to be colorblind‑friendly (blues for favorable, amber/orange for higher burden). Exact hex values are in the sidebar component’s `RANK_STYLES`.

## 8. Summary

| What                    | How it’s done                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scale breakpoints       | 20th, 40th, 60th, 80th percentiles of the variable over all hexes            |
| Band assignment         | Compare each hex’s value to q20, q40, q60, q80 (same for map and sidebar)     |
| Legend numbers          | Same q20–q80; formatted by type (integer for population, % for 0–1, etc.)     |
| Map filter              | Show only hexes whose value falls in the selected band’s range               |
| Sidebar “Xth percentile”| For 0–1 vars: value×100; else linear interpolation between quantiles          |
| Overall burden          | Average of 1–5 ranks across factors, then map average to Very Low … Very High |

All of this uses **only** the loaded GeoJSON (e.g. CHEL 2022). There are no hardcoded breakpoints; changing the dataset or the set of hexes will change q20–q80 and thus the legend and all derived values.
